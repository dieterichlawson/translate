subclause reordering

- In Dutch, the ordering in a dependent clause is SUBJECT ... VERB where SUBJECT is at the beginning of the clause and VERB is at the end. In English the order is SUBJECT VERB ... . We identify the clause by looking for a POS that is tagged IN.
Then we look for the first PRP or NN(S), which we identify as the subject.
The first verb is the VERB. We then move the VERB to the position right after the SUBJECT.


- In Dutch, sentences can start with 'Adverb Verb Subject ...'. In these sentences we switch verb and subject. to create a better sounding English sentence. 

- QUESTION RULE
  If the sentence is a question and the translation gives us a Verb as the first word, we switch the Verb with the first noun + the word preceding the noun. IE. "VERB 'the' Noun" -> "'the' Noun Verb".
  This is neccessary because for example, in our passage we have a sentence that when translated gave us "Received the students suffcient support?" So our rule in this case will take the 
  first noun/subject along with it's preceding word, "the student", and will move it infront of the verb "Received" giving "The students received suffcient support". There are other options
  for handling such cases, but this one allowed us to keep the same words that were given in the translation and didn't require us to change the Verb tense. Another option could have rephrased
  the question as "Did the students receive suffcient support?", but without more question type sentences to train our model, the decision to change the tesne of "received" and to add the words
  "did the" would likely cause more issues than its worth.

disambiguation rules

- Dutch doesn't always distinguish between 'which' and 'who' if we see a 'which' and the word before is tagged as a 'personal pronoun' we change it into 'who'

- 'het' can be 'it' or 'the'. We translate it as 'it' and change it to 
the' if the following word is a noun.

- 'dan' -> then / than by looking at previous word (than if it is a comparative, then otherwise)

- mis -> mass / miss / wrong by looking at the previous word. if it is 'de'(determiner) 'mis' is translated as 'mass'. if 'mis' is preceded by a personal pronoun, it is translated as 'miss' (the verb). else it is translated as 'wrong'

- choose between 'a' and 'an' by looking at next word

- 'iets' can mean 'a little' or 'something', if te word succeeding it is a comparative, it is usually used as 'a little'
