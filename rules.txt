subclause reordering

- In Dutch, the ordering in a dependent clause is SUBJECT ... VERB where SUBJECT is at the beginning of the clause and VERB is at the end. In English the order is SUBJECT VERB ... . We identify the clause by looking for a POS that is tagged IN.
Then we look for the first PRP or NN(S), which we identify as the subject.
The first verb is the VERB. We then move the VERB to the position right after the SUBJECT.


- In Dutch, sentences can start with 'Adverb Verb Subject ...'. In these sentences we switch verb and subject. to create a better sounding English sentence.

disambiguation rules

- Dutch doesn't always distinguish between 'which' and 'who' if we see a 'which' and the word before is tagged as a 'personal pronoun' we change it into 'who'

- 'het' can be 'it' or 'the'. We translate it as 'it' and change it to 
the' if the following word is a noun.

- 'dan' -> then / than by looking at previous word (than if it is a comparative, then otherwise)

- mis -> mass / miss / wrong by looking at the previous word. if it is 'de'(determiner) 'mis' is translated as 'mass'. if 'mis' is preceded by a personal pronoun, it is translated as 'miss' (the verb). else it is translated as 'wrong'

- choose between 'a' and 'an' by looking at next word

- 'iets' can mean 'a little' or 'something', if te word succeeding it is a comparative, it is usually used as 'a little'
