subclause reordering

- In Dutch, the ordering in a dependent clause is SUBJECT ... VERB where SUBJECT is at the beginning of the clause and VERB is at the end. In English the order is SUBJECT VERB ... . We identify the clause by looking for a POS that is tagged IN.
Then we look for the first PRP or NN(S), which we identify as the subject.
The first verb is the VERB. We then move the VERB to the position right after the SUBJECT.


- In Dutch, sentences can start with 'Adverb Verb Subject ...'. In these sentences we switch verb and subject. to create a better sounding English sentence. 

- QUESTION RULE
-If the sentence is a question and the translation gives us a Verb as the first word, we switch the verb with the first noun + the word preceding the noun. IE. Verb 'the' Noun -> 'the' Noun Verb.

disambiguation rules

- Dutch doesn't always distinguish between 'which' and 'who' if we see a 'which' and the word before is tagged as a 'personal pronoun' we change it into 'who'

- 'het' can be 'it' or 'the'. We translate it as 'it' and change it to 
the' if the following word is a noun.

- 'dan' -> then / than by looking at previous word (than if it is a comparative, then otherwise)

- mis -> mass / miss / wrong by looking at the previous word. if it is 'de'(determiner) 'mis' is translated as 'mass'. if 'mis' is preceded by a personal pronoun, it is translated as 'miss' (the verb). else it is translated as 'wrong'

- choose between 'a' and 'an' by looking at next word

- 'iets' can mean 'a little' or 'something', if te word succeeding it is a comparative, it is usually used as 'a little'

SHOULD/MUST RULES
    In Dutch many of the 'modals' (should,must,may,etc...) are placed differently than in English.
    Many times they are at the end of the sentence after the direct object, or far from the subject,
    giving phrases like 'the diploma must get' and 'exams better should become spread'.
    Additionally, the modals are sometimes not next to the verb that they modify, which
    gives awkward phrases like 'should spelling errors with the cloak of love be covered'.

    This rule attempts to reorder the modal phrases to be Subject - Modal - Verb - Direct Object,
    e.g. "The pigs should eat their food".

    The first step, rearrange_modals, looks for noun phrases around any modals in a sentence. If a
    noun phrase is found to the left but not to the right, we can assume that it is situated after the DO
    and move it into position after the DO. If there is a noun phrase to the right but not the left,
    we can assume that it is situated before the subject and relocate it after the subject. If there are
    noun phrases on both sides, we assume it is in order and leave it alone.

    In the second step, rearrange_modal_verbs, we check and see if the verb phrase that the modal modifies
    is next to it, and if it isn't, we relocate it. This amounts to scanning for a verb phrase
    after the position of the modal, and moving it next to the modal if it isn't already there.

    The last step, disamb_become, simple changes all instances of 'should become' to 'should be'.
